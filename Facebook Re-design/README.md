#Facebook-Redesign
###While using Facebook, I began to think about how it's currently designed, and I thought of several fundamental flaws that could be improved on, and attempted to re-design it with those flaws in mind.
The biggest issue is the lack of integration of Messenger into Facebook itself. Currently, [Facebook Messenger] (http://messenger.com) exists separately, and Facebook still has its own messaging page. In addition, you cannot collapse the sidebar that displays available contacts, and you can not move or resize the mini chat-windows which generally block the view of your news feed. As such, I tried to integrate Messenger into Facebook. 
The other issue I had was the lack of customizability. There are so many different things happening on the desktop page at once - while I personally like that, I know others that don't (maybe they don't use groups or events or fundraising or apps, etc). What I thus did then, was split the page into sections, which theoretically can be added/removed. If you simply want to view your Newsfeed, you can eliminate all other distractions. If you want to just view messenger, you can do that as well. Basically, you can add and remove blocks so that either a great deal or a very small amount is going on in the webpage you are viewing - but that is up to you.
Lastly, I tried to give it a more flat, updated, and minimalistic look.
